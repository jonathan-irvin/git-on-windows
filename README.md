# Git on Windows

*A short tutorial on how I set up Git on Windows Computers*

1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and download the latest copy of Git for Windows. (The download will start automatically).
2. Run the Installer.
3. For the most part, stick with the defaults, except when you get to **Adjusting your PATH environment**, select **Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt**.
4. When you get to **Configuring the line ending conversions** make sure that is set on **Checkout Windows-style line endings, commit unix style line endings**.
